I posted my `previous blog post about Kubernetes failure stories <https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-failure-stories.html>`_ on Hacker News (HN) last Sunday, exactly one week ago.
Here is what happened afterwards.

.. TEASER_END

The `Hacker News post <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18953647>`_ received 510 points (upvotes) and 228 comments so far.
The post was shown on the HN homepage for about one and a half days. The topic apparently hit a nerve.

The number of GitHub stars went up to 1.5k and I received `two pull requests <https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories/pulls>`_ with additional failure stories.

The `German Linux Magazin wrote an online article "Geschichten Ã¼ber Kubernetes Fails" <http://www.linux-magazin.de/news/geschichten-ueber-kubernetes-fails/>`_ about the topic.

Someone `posted a link to my blog post on Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/ai03gk/kubernetes_failure_stories/>`_. It has 11 comments, so might be worth a look.

The blog post was `mentioned in KubeWeekly #160 <https://us10.campaign-archive.com/?u=3885586f8f1175194017967d6&id=7ebfd3c3f0>`_.

Craig Box and Adam Glick invited me for an episode of the `Kubernetes Podcast by Google <https://kubernetespodcast.com/>`_. I don't know yet when the episode will be published.

I hope to see more contributions for the `list of Kubernetes Failure Stories <https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories>`_ in the future.
That was the main reason for me to post the topic, so let me know `on Twitter <https://twitter.com/try_except_>`_ or `GitHub <https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories>`_ if you have a story to share!
