There is a large gap on this blog --- no posts since 2014! I don't even try to explain, so I will just try to reboot his blog and post more regularly.
I took a close look at Hugo_ to replace Nikola_ as the static site generator.
Hugo looks easy to use, but in the end I came to the conclusion that the content (writing blog posts!) should be the focus and I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of
replacing my static site generator and/or theme (for now).

.. TEASER_END

So I just did minor adjustments to update to the latest Nikola release (version 8.01). This required `some adaptation in the base "list" template <https://github.com/hjacobs/srcco.de/commit/9b47e8b42e55d1983833dfbdcd2903ad4bff5b6e>`_, but otherwise the version upgrade worked like a charm!
